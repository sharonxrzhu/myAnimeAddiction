          <h3> Mitsuha Miyamizu </h3>
          <p>
            Mitsuha Miyamizu lives a very small town in the countryside of Japan where there's not even a cafe shop. She lives with her grandmother and little sister. The Misyamizu family is tradition and Mitsuha and her sister become priestesses at the Miyamizu shrine. Because of their religious family background, seems like their whole family had the experience of switching lives with other in their dreams at the age of high school, and so did Mitsuha with Taki.
