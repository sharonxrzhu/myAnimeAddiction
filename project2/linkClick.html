        <h2>Description:</h2><p>There's a small shop named "Time Photo Gallery", it was run by Qiao Ling, Lu Guang and Cheng Xiaoshi.  Lu Guang and Cheng Xiaoshi have special abilties to enter photos. To complete the costumer's needs, Cheng Xiaoshi can transfer into the phototaker, control and experience the next 12 hours of the photo's history using the phototaker's body, while Luguang can see what has happened to make sure Chengxiaoshi does not change the results of history, because changing history will change everything after in the future, and they try to avoid that from happening. They are partners. They can only transfer into each photo once, which means they only have one chance per photo. Their slogan is "no matter past or future, just let them be". However, they cannot always make sure nothing is changed in the future due to their actions, and things started to get out of their control.</p>
